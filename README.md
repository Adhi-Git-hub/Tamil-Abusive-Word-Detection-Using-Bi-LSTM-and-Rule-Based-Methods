# Tamil-Abusive-Word-Detection-Using-Bi-LSTM-and-Rule-Based-Methods
In this project, we addressed the challenge of low abusive word detection in Tamil text, a significant issue in online discourse. Utilizing a hybrid approach, we developed a robust model that combines deep learning with rule-based methods to accurately predict abusive content in sentences.
